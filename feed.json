I can still access the database but I have to extract everything by hand. I've started the process but it's been a nightmare. I had another blog that also had an upgrade disaster but after 2 years I was able to recover that one.</p>\n<p>I love Ghost Blog but manually hosting shouldn't be this hard. I have had upgrade issues a few times in the past but at least I could recover. This last one was related to an upgrade to Mysql 8.0. Something to do with encoding. I have wasted hours trying to fix it. </p>\n<p>With that behind me I am going to try use Publii to create the static site. Those posts are then uploaded to Github which in turn is then sent to Cloudfront pages. I have migrated several wordpress sites to static sites on S3. I thought I should try something different this time. </p>",
