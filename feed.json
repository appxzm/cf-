            "content_html": "<p>This is my review of UCC Brazil Luciana whole bean coffee. It's my second whole bean bag of coffee that was purchased in Japan.</p>\n<p>This particular bag was bought in a grocery store in Yokohama.</p>\n<p>UCC Bracil Luciana might be the name of the coffee but all I know for sure is the company is called UCC. I found them on the web and they do have a place in Brazil. As far as purchasing more that I have no idea about.</p>\n<p>Let's get to what rally matters. How does it taste. The answer to that question isn't very straightforward. It has a strong flavor but it's not actually bold. As a strong shot or as espresso it comes off with a tinge of bitterness with complexities of chocolate? Sorry if it sounds weird but please don't let the word \"bitterness\" how you off. Think Starbucks burnt but without the aftertaste.</p>\n<p>The beans were a dark French Roast and it was no where near my favorite espresso shot. However, as a latte it was amazing. For whatever scientific reason that I don't know it turned into one of my favorites for homemade coffee drinks.</p>\n<p>In the end I must say that I enjoy this coffee but keep in mind that it should be paired. It doesn't hold its own very well by itself.</p>",

I can still access the database but I have to extract everything by hand. I've started the process but it's been a nightmare. I had another blog that also had an upgrade disaster but after 2 years I was able to recover that one.</p>\n<p>I love Ghost Blog but manually hosting shouldn't be this hard. I have had upgrade issues a few times in the past but at least I could recover. This last one was related to an upgrade to Mysql 8.0. Something to do with encoding. I have wasted hours trying to fix it. </p>\n<p>With that behind me I am going to try use Publii to create the static site. Those posts are then uploaded to Github which in turn is then sent to Cloudfront pages. I have migrated several wordpress sites to static sites on S3. I thought I should try something different this time. </p>",
