It's my second whole bean bag of coffee that was purchased in Japan.</p><p>This particular bag was bought in a grocery store in Yokohama.</p><p>UCC Bracil Luciana might be the name of the coffee but all I know for sure is the company is called UCC. I found them on the web and they do have a place in Brazil. As far as purchasing more that I have no idea about.</p><p>Let's get to what rally matters. How does it taste. The answer to that question isn't very straightforward. It has a strong flavor but it's not actually bold. As a strong shot or as espresso it comes off with a tinge of bitterness with complexities of chocolate? Sorry if it sounds weird but please don't let the word "bitterness" how you off. Think Starbucks burnt but without the aftertaste.</p><p>The beans were a dark French Roast and it was no where near my favorite espresso shot. However, as a latte it was amazing. For whatever scientific reason that I don't know it turned into one of my favorites for homemade coffee drinks.</p><p>In the end I must say that I enjoy this coffee but keep in mind that it should be paired. It doesn't hold its own very well by itself.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 5, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://buecker.github.io/ramblingsinthesky/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
